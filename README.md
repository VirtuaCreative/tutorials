Hello, there!

This is a new Virtua Creative website. After a few years focusing only on a full-time job,
I'm back on playing around with different technologies and bringing tutorials to the community.
Not sure how often I'll be blogging but I'll try to come back here more often.

This repo contains the codebase for a website based on the Jekyll theme "[Chirpy](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/jekyll-theme-chirpy/)",
very nicely done. Adjusting the template for my website is still a WIP.

I hope you enjoy the tutorials and feel free to fork and reuse the codebase, but don't forget the license.

Now I welcome you to read the [blog posts](https://github.virtuacreative.com.br/jekyll-on-docker/). ðŸ˜‰
