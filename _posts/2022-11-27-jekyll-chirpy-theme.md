# Jekyll is thankfully great again

There's been a couple of years I had left Jekyll behind me for a few reasons, as follows.

-  One day I started a new Jekyll site and all I could find was a gem. How could
I quickly customize my layouts and CSS and everything else within a _gem_?
Way too time-consuming to change a link, a color, a border radius, whatever.
Unbelievable.
- I started working on Ruby-based SSGs like Nanoc and Middleman.
- I started to use WordPress for real-deal CMS.
- I found a tool called [Mobirise](https://mobirise.com/), very handy to just build
a static site quickly, out of the blue.
- I switched from GitHub Pages to GitLab Pages, with which I had more control over the
build and the deployment process with GitLab CI/CD.

Bottom line, Jekyll lost its charm for me.
But until that point, I loved it. Life took me into another path, though.

Now I'm back in the game with more time to play around,
so I decided to take another look at Jekyll to see what happened while I was elsewhere. And
all my favorite `_xxx` folders are back! Woot woot! No gems! Yay! So I couldn't wait to
get my hands back on it.

So I decided to install it again on my MacBook but I didn't want to make a mess
with tons of incompatible dependency managers. So I went for building a Jekyll site on a Docker
container. Huge success! I explained how I made it work on a [previous blog post](../jekyll-on-docker-github-pages/).

## The Chirpy theme

Next step: which theme should I choose? I quickly browsed through my well-known list of [Jekyll themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/)
and the design of this one, [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy), caught my eyes.
At a glance, and thought that it looked cool for a test.

Oh boy. What a theme. Worked perfectly with Docker, then with GH Pages, and now, the more I
explore it, the more surprised I get. It's definitely my new blog.

It is very well built with tons of features, easy to adapt, easy to figure out, beautifully
designed, pleasant to explore. So, this post is just to compliment the author and to let you folks
know that if you are interested in a nice theme, this is a great option indeed.

I won't list all its features as you can see them by yourself if you take a look at their presentation.

Hope to have helped you in your choice.

Best of luck and Happy Jekylling!
